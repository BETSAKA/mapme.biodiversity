\item{shp}{A single polygon for which to calculate the tree cover statistic}

\item{treecover}{The treecover 2000 resource from GFW}

\item{lossyear}{The lossyear resource from GFW}

\item{minSize}{The minimum size of a forest patch in ha.}

\item{minCover}{The minimum threshold of stand density for a pixel to be considered forest in the year 2000.}

A tibble

\description{
Considering the 2000 GFW forest cover density layer users can specify
a cover threshold above which a pixel is considered to be covered by forest.
Additionally, users can specify a minimum size of a comprehensive patch of
forest pixels. Patches below this threshold will not be considered as forest area.
