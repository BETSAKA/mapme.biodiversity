Description: Biodiversity areas, especially primary forest, serve a multitude
  of functions for local economy, regional functionality of the ecosystems as well 
  as the global health of our planet. Recently, adverse changes in human landuse
  practices and climatic responses to increased greenhouse gas emissions, put 
  these biodiversity areas under a variety of different threats. mapme.biodiversity
  helps to analyse a number of biodiversity indicators based on freely available
  geodatasets. It supports computational efficient routines that allow the analysis
  of potentially global biodiversity portfolios. The primary use case of the 
  package is to support evidence based reporting of an organization's effort to 
  protect biodiversity areas under threat and to identify regions were intervention
  is most duly needed.
