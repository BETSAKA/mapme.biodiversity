## About

Biodiversity areas, especially primary forests, serve a multitude
of functions for local economy, regional ecosystem services as well 
as the global health of our planet. Exapnsion of human landuse
 and climatic responses to increased greenhouse gas emissions put 
these biodiversity areas under threat. mapme.biodiversity
helps to analyse a number of biodiversity indicators based on freely available
data-sources such as the Global Foerst Watch. It supports computational efficient routines in the statistical programming language R that allow for the analysis
of global biodiversity portfolios with a multitude of areas such as protected areas from the World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA). The primary use case of the 
package is to support scientific analysis and data science for organizations who seek to preserve the planets biodiversity. 


**Important Note** 
The development is currently work in progress. Additional information will be published here shortly.
