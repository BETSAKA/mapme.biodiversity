## About

Biodiversity areas, especially primary forests provide multiple ecosystem services for the local population and the planet as a whole. The rapid exapnsion of human landuse into natural ecosystems and the impacts of the global climate crisis put natural ecosystems and the global biodiversity under threat. The mapme.biodiversity
package helps to analyse a number of biodiversity related indicators and biodiversity threats based on freely available data-sources such as the Global Foerst Watch. It supports computational efficient routines and heavy parallelization in cloud-infrastructures using in the statistical programming language R. The package allows for the analysis of global biodiversity portfolios with a multitude of areas which is normally only possible on dedicated plattforms such as the Google Earth Engine. This package nevertheless is plattform agnostic and provides the possibility to e.g. anayse thousands of areas from the World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA). The primary use case of this package is to support scientific analysis and data science for organizations who seek to preserve the planets biodiversity. It's development is funded by the German Development Bank KfW.  


**Important Note** 
The development is currently work in progress. Additional information will be published here shortly.
