## About

Biodiversity areas, especially primary forest, serve a multitude
of functions for local economy, regional functionality of the ecosystems as well 
as the global health of our planet. Recently, adverse changes in human landuse
practices and climatic responses to increased greenhouse gas emissions, put 
these biodiversity areas under a variety of different threats. mapme.biodiversity
helps to analyse a number of biodiversity indicators based on freely available
geodatasets. It supports computational efficient routines that allow the analysis
of potentially global biodiversity portfolios. The primary use case of the 
package is to support evidence based reporting of an organization's effort to 
protect biodiversity areas under threat and to identify regions were intervention
is most duly needed. 


**Important Note** 
The development is currently work in progress. Additional information will be published here shortly.
