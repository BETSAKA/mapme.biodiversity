## About

Biodiversity areas, especially primary forests, provide multiple
ecosystem services for the local population and the planet as a whole.
The rapid expansion of human land use into natural ecosystems and the
impacts of the global climate crisis put natural ecosystems and the
global biodiversity under threat.

The mapme.biodiversity package helps to analyse a number of biodiversity
related indicators and biodiversity threats based on freely available
geodata-sources such as the Global Forest Watch. It supports
computational efficient routines and heavy parallel computing in
cloud-infrastructures such as AWS or Microsoft Azure using in the statistical
programming language R. The package allows for the analysis of global
biodiversity portfolios with a thousand or millions of AOIs which is
normally only possible on dedicated platforms such as the Google Earth
Engine. It provides the possibility to e.g. analyse the World Database
of Protected Areas (WDPA) for a number of relevant indicators. The
primary use case of this package is to support scientific analysis and
data science for individuals and organizations who seek to preserve the
planet biodiversity. Its development is funded by the German
Development Bank KfW.

## Installation

The package and its dependencies can be installed from CRAN via:

```{r install-cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("mapme.biodiversity", dependencies = TRUE)
```

To install the development version, use the following command:

```{r install-devel, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/mapme-initiative/mapme.biodiversity", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Available resources and indicators

Below is a list of the resources currently supported by `mapme.biodiversity`.

```{r available_resources, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(mapme.biodiversity::available_resources()[, c("name", "description", "licence")])
```


Next, is a list of supported indicators.

```{r available_indicators, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(mapme.biodiversity::available_indicators()[, c("name", "description")])
```



## Usage example

`{mapme.biodiversity}` works by constructing a portfolio from an sf
object. Specific raster and vector resource matching the spatio-temporal
extent of the portfolio are made available locally. Once all required
resources are available, indicators can be calculated individually for
each asset in the portfolio.

```{r resources}
library(mapme.biodiversity)
library(sf)
```

Once you have decided on an indicator you are interested in, you can
start by making the required resource available for your portfolio. 
Using `mapme_options()` you can set an output directory and control the verbosity
of the package. 

A portfolio is represented by an sf-object. It is required for the object to only
contain geometries of type `POLYGON` as assets. We can request the download of a
resource for the spatial extent of our portfolio by using the `get_resources()`
function. We simply supply our portfolio and one or more resource functions. 
Once the resources were made available, we can query the calculation of an 
indicator by using the `calc_indicators()` function. This function also expects
the portfolio as input and one or more indicator functions. Once the indicator 
has been calculated for all assets in a portfolio, the data is returned as a 
nested list column to the original portfolio object. The output of each 
indicator is standardized to common format, consisting of a tibble with columns
`datetime`, `variable`, `unit`, and `value`.

```{r calculation}
mapme_options(
  outdir = system.file("res", package = "mapme.biodiversity"),
  verbose = FALSE
)

(system.file("extdata", "sierra_de_neiba_478140_2.gpkg", package = "mapme.biodiversity") %>%
  sf::read_sf() %>%
  get_resources(
    get_gfw_treecover(version = "GFC-2020-v1.8"),
    get_gfw_lossyear(version = "GFC-2020-v1.8"),
    get_gfw_emissions()
  ) %>%
  calc_indicators(calc_treecover_area_and_emissions(years = 2016:2017, min_size = 1, min_cover = 30)) %>%
  tidyr::unnest(treecover_area_and_emissions))
```


## A note on parallel computing

`{mapme.biodiversity}` follows the parallel computing paradigm of the
[`{future}`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=future) 
package. That means that you as a user are in the control if and how you would 
like to set up parallel processing. Currently, `{mapme.biodiversity}` supports 
parallel processing on the asset level of the `calc_indicators()` function only. We
also currently assume that parallel processing is done on the cores of a single 
machine. In future developments, we would like to support distributed processing.
If you are working on a distributed use-cases, please contact the developers,
e.g. via the [discussion board](https://github.com/mapme-initiative/mapme.biodiversity/discussions) or mail.

To process 6 assets in parallel and report a progress bar you will have to set 
up the following in your code:

```{r parallel, eval = FALSE}
library(future)
library(progressr)

plan(multisession, workers = 6) # set up parallel plan

with_progress({
  aoi <- calc_indicators(
    aoi,
    calc_treecover_area_and_emissions(
      min_size = 1,
      min_cover = 30
    )
  )
})

plan(sequential) # close child processes
```

Note, that the above code uses `future::multisession()` as the parallel backend.
This backend will resolve the calculation in multiple background R sessions.
You should use that backend if you are operating on Windows, using RStudio or
otherwise are not sure about which backend to use. In case you are operating on 
a system that allows process forking and are *not* using RStudio, consider
using `future::multicore()` for more efficient parallel processing.

Head over to the [online
documentation](https://mapme-initiative.github.io/mapme.biodiversity/index.html)
