The most important steps of the processing workflow of `{mapme.biodiversity}` 
are described here. A typical workflow consists of the following steps:

-  initialization of a portfolio object from an `{sf}` object together with portfolio-wide parameters
-  identify the required resources needed for the indicators you want to calculate
-  download one or more resources that are required for your desired indicators
-  automated calculation of the indicators for all assets within a portfolio
-  then, you are free to conduct your statistical analysis within R, or,
-  you can export the portfolio as a GeoPackage to share with others or use it with other Geo-spatial software (e.g. QGIS)
